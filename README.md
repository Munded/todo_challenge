**User Stories**
```
As a forgetful person
I want to store my tasks
So that I don't forget them

As a person who actually gets stuff done
I want to mark my tasks as done
So that I don't do them twice

As a person who doesn't like counting by hand
I want to see a total number of tasks
So that I don't have to count

As someone who has done lots of stuff
I want to be able to clear my completed tasks
So I never see them again
